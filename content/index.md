# About Me

## Software Engineer Extraordinaire
As a software engineer, my world revolves around turning ideas into elegant, functional solutions. My journey in code has taken me through the various landscapes of programming languages, frameworks and algorithmic challenges. Check out my [[homebase|list of projects]] where I meticulously capture my learnings, breakthroughs, and the fascinating quirks of the coding universe.

## Artistic Explorer
But there's more to me than just code. I'd like to think that I am more of a creative at heart. From old school pen and ink works to a more modern and digital mediums such as Blender and even exploring the convergence or art and programming through generative and algorithmic art, you can find a whole variety or mediums, styles and structures that I have tried out over the years.

## The Chronicles of Learning
Step into my virtual notebook, where I share ~~the raw, unfiltered~~ documentation of my learning journey. Whether it's debugging a complex algorithm or capturing the essence of a fleeting artistic idea, my Obsidian notes are a testament to my dedication to continuous improvement in both the realms of code and canvas.
